#The **summery** of good devleoper mind-set

the good developer seek for simplicity ,he show his intelligence by simplicity 

>simplicity means a code that is easy to understand from others, its purpose to help people and its consistance . 

also, he have no proplem to ask for help when he stuck ,also he keep learning and not be bias for any tools ,
he write comment and documentation: comment in order to show why he do this code not what his code mean,ducumentation to describe the full picture of his software to help other understande his work .

finally,he try to divide the proplems and the projects he have to a small tasks and try to solve it task by task and he test each code after writting it .
